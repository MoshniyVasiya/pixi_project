###### **Clone** repository files 
###### **Run** ` npm i `
###### And finish with command ` http-server `


###### project summary:
  * Still don't understand why some times random figure falling with wrong **Gravity speed**
  * Surface area occupied by shapes counts as `1` (see `console.log(space`)) *Figure witch creates by clicking on empty area* - due to the fact that i don't know how to calculate the "Heart" figure space. With similar figures it's possible just as in random figures formula
  * Rarely random figure can freeze for a few milliseconds, think the key in working with array of figures.
